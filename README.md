# High-Resolution-Real-Time-2D-Force-Sensor-System-for-Wind-Tunnel-Experiments
high-precision load measurement system to assess various wing structures in a low-speed wind tunnel. This project reviews, designs, and implements a proof-of-concept system. This paper explains a method to detect two different wing forces in the wind tunnel with high frequency (2kHz) and high accuracy (mN), which might be useful for future bio-inspired sensor systems.
